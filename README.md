An introduction to NumPy:-

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant

NumPy stands for Numerical Python

Numpy is a Python library used for working with arrays

NumPy provides an array object that is upto 50x faster than Lists

NumPy arrays are stored in continous memory space unlike Lists, so processes can access and manipulate them efficently;This behaviour is called 'Locaity of reference'
